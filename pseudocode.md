# Choose Your Own Adventure!

Using what you know about data types, variables, operators, conditional blocks, and accepting user input, create a text-based game that allows the user to arrive at different "destinations" based on the inputs they type.

### Rules
* Any path the user goes down must ask them at least **three** questions.
* There must be a minimum of **seven** total destinations the user could arrive at based on their responses.
* For **at least one** of the questions asked, there must be **more than two possible user responses**.
* Your code must contain **at least one loop**.
* Your code must make use of **both string and number user inputs**.
> **Hint:** You may need `parseInt()` and `toString()`
